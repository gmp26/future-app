# future-app

A working snapshot of a working implementation of [re-natal v0.3.3](https://github.com/drapanjanas/re-natal) commit 105ecaeef.

It's here in case I need to refer to a working copy later.

It was created by
```
re-natal init FutureApp -i rum
```

and worked in both the IOS and Android simulators with and without figwheel.

## Usage
